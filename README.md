# iBox
Console puzzle game about an Isakaya AI robot organizing boxes.

This Game Jam was organized by the NBCC - Game Development students to practice after the first Fall term. The only experience they had at this moment was to create games with console output.

The GJ's restrictions were to build a console game with the theme **Artificial Intelligence**.

IBox is a puzzle game about an artificial intelligence created in the distant future. The game has onle a few levels and not much story, but the good thing is that the levels and stories can be read from an external json file allowing anyone to create their own puzzle game with story.

Make sure to copy the file `game.json` next to the executable when running outside of Visual Studio.
